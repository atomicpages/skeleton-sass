Skeleton Sass 2
=======================

Skeleton Sass is a "Sassification" of Dave Gamache's [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com) responsive Sass starting point.

* Ability to seamlessly adjust grids by changing the value of variables
* Install Skeleton Sass with bower via `bower install skeleton-sass`
* [Live demo!](http://atomicpages.github.io/skeleton-sass/demo/index.html)
* [Extensive documentation](https://github.com/atomicpages/skeleton-sass/wiki)

### Life after 2.5
* At some point after 2.5 I would like to create a Ruby Gem of Skeleton Sass with Rails/Sinatra support. This will likely be the next major release (i.e. 3.0).

### Upgrading From 1.x
Skeleton Sass 2.x is **not** backwards compatible with Skeleton Sass 1.x due to a major change in the file structure. However, we have a [wiki article](https://github.com/atomicpages/skeleton-sass/wiki/Upgrade-from-1-to-2) that explains how to upgrade from Skeleton Sass 1 to Skeleton Sass 2.

### Looking for Skeleton Sass 1?
We still have the latest stable release available to download if you wish! Head over to the [1.x-master branch](https://github.com/atomicpages/skeleton-sass/tree/1.x-master) and continue using Skeleton Sass 1. Version 1 docs can be found [here](https://github.com/atomicpages/skeleton-sass/wiki/Version-1-Docs).

## TL;DR
Skeleton Sass is a Sass port of Skeleton CSS. Skeleton Sass 2 has been trimmed down and a **ton** of new features have been added.

Note: If you are new to Sass altogether then please read our [wiki](https://github.com/atomicpages/skeleton-sass/wiki) for a more in-depth look at Skeleton Sass, information regarding installing ruby and Sass, and many other valuable resources!

If you are not new to Sass and you've tried other Skeleton CSS Sass ports and had a feeling is dissatisfaction, then look no more. Skeleton Sass is your last stop.

### Features
1. DRY
2. Customizable
3. Themeable
4. Bower ready
5. Upgradeable

### Dependencies
The only dependency for Skeleton Sass to run is Sass 3.3+. Any other libraries (e.g. Bourbon) are up to you to include if you wish.

**Warning:** The current stable release of Compass does *not* support Sass 3.3.x. Skeleton Sass uses functions that are a part of that version. There are currently alpha builds of Compass 1.x that do support Sass 3.3.x

### File Overview
* `bin` a directory that contains ruby executables

	* `update.rb` a ruby script that handles updating Skeleton Sass (in progress)
* `skeleton` where all of the magic happens
	* `core`
		* `_config.scss` the default global configuration variables
		* `_dependencies.scss` the default global logic for Skeleton Sass

			* `_vars.scss` contains project-scoped configuration options and variables
		* `sphenoid` the main theme bundled with Skeleton Sass
			* `marrow` the directory that contains all of the project-scoped logic (e.g. functions and mixins) for your theme to work
				* `_private.scss` a file that contains all of the private logic for the public mixins/functions to work correctly for the `sphenoid` project. Feel free to name this file whatever you want in your own theme.
				* `_public.scss` a file that contains all of the public mixins/functions for the `sphenoid` theme. Feel free to name this file whatever you want in your own theme.

### Bower
> Bower is a package manager for the web. It offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build stack. There are no system wide dependencies, no dependencies are shared between different apps, and the dependency tree is flat &mdash; [bower.io](http://bower.io/)

Install Skeleton Sass with bower via command line:

	bower install skeleton-sass

You can also install alpha, beta, rc, and previous versions by looking at the [releases](https://github.com/atomicpages/skeleton-sass/releases) page and install with the following syntax:

	bower install skeleton-sass#[tag]
	bower install skeleton-sass#2.0.0-b2

[Learn how to set up Skeleton Sass for the first time here](https://github.com/atomicpages/skeleton-sass/wiki/Setting-up-Skeleton-Sass-for-first-time-use).

### NPM
> npm is a package manager for JavaScript, and is the default for Node.js

Install Skeleton Sass with npm via command line

	npm install skeleton-sass --save

### RequireJS installation for ReactJS applications
>Most of the ReactJS boilerplates built with RequireJS which you need to require the Sass/Scss files within the application.

Install Skeleton Sass with npm via command line

	npm install skeleton-sass --save

Require the Skeleton Sass within your React / RequireJS application

	require('skeleton-sass');

### Demo
You can see Skeleton Sass in action here: [http://atomicpages.github.io/skeleton-sass](http://atomicpages.github.io/skeleton-sass). Be sure to resize your browser window and see the responsive goodness in action!

Changelog
---------
### 2.5.1
* Fixes [issue #16](https://github.com/atomicpages/skeleton-sass/issues/16)

### 2.5.0
* Addition of a new default theme called **fresh**
	* Removal of old reset CSS in favor of [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
		* Although, you can always use `reset.css` if you wish since it will still be part of the theme mixins!
	* Adjustment of media queries
		* **Note:** these media queries probably won't be perfect for _every_ project. Let the content dictate the media queries!
	* Fluid grid is now the default with a fixed width set on the `body` element (you can change this behavior, of course)
		* **Note:** the fixed grid will still be there! Difference is that the fluid grid will be the new default with the new theme only. You can still use the old `sphenoid` theme for the pre 2.5 setup (e.g. fixed grid, old skeleton.css theme, `reset.css`, etc.).
	* New default font: [Raleway](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Raleway)
* Improvements with scripts and better compatibility with Ruby 2.x and better backward compatibility with Ruby 1.8+

###### Removals
* `$colWidth` variable in the `@grid` mixin
* Removed some sloppy code in the `@_offsets` mixin

###### Fixes/Changes
* Plural `column` and `columns` for `one-third`, `two-third`, and `full-width`

###### New Features/Themes
* `one-half` selector to grid
* `$new` parameter to `@_fluidGrid` and `@_fixedGrid`. This makes some basic changes to the grid for the new Skeleton CSS format
* Default fixed/fluid combo grid for `fresh` theme
	* Updated offsets for the new fixed/fluid grid combo
* Added new `offset-by-one-third`, `.offset-by-two-thirds`, and `.offset-by-one-half` selectors for new grid

### 2.0.0

###### Removals
* Removed `$baseWidthMQ`
* Removed `bourbon` and `compass` to completely flatten the dependency tree so all you need now is Sass 3.3+

###### Fixes/Changes
* **Huge** changes to the structure of Skeleton Sass
* No more camelCase variables (based on what we've seen the convention seems to prefer hyphens in variable names).
* Squashed some old, lingering bugs with the gradient mixins
* All of the logic has been moved to the `skeleton/core` folder
* Completely removed `layout.scss` (media queries defined in the old layout file now live in `skeleton_template.scss`)
* Fixed a few linger misspellings in a few selectors
* Cleaned and optimized old mixins/functions
* `$base-width` is now calculated automatically

###### New Features
* Introduced global variables, mixins, and functions
* Introduced a new concept to Skeleton Sass called _themes_. Themes allow you to edit the base styles to create a new launching platform for your projects. When you create a theme, it won't get overridden with an update to Skeleton Sass. [Learn more about themes here](https://github.com/atomicpages/skeleton-sass/wiki/Creating-a-theme).
* Ruby scripts that help you setup Skeleton Sass for first time use, create themes, update Skleton Sass, and more
* New functions and mixins:
	* `_calcRU` is a function meant to be used in other functions. This function calculates the relative unit based on the `$base-font-size` and the `$size` passed into the function. These functions depend on `_calcRU`
		* `em`
		* `rem`
		* `percent`
		* `relative`
	* `em` converts an absolute `px` unit to an `em` unit
	* `rem` converts an absolute `px` unit to a `rem` unit
	* `percent` converts an absolute `px` unit to a `%` unit
	* `relative` converts an absolute `px` unit to the chosen relative unit as defined in `_config.scss` or your own project configuration.
		* **Note:** if more than one relative unit is select then this function will simply spit out the `px` unit. // documentation is needed
	* `@font-size` is a *mixin* that handles everything involving `font-size`. // TODO complete this
* Added a grid generator helper in [atomicpages.github.io/skeleton-sass/](http://atomicpages.github.io/skeleton-sass/)
